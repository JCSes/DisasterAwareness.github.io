This site will serve as a helpful tool in providing people with the crucial information of what to do and what not to do before, during, or after a natural disaster, but more specifically, during an **earthquake**.

But before we dive straight into this topic, lets first, know what the what an earthquake is, what causes it and how do these affect us and/or our  environment both negatively and positively.

## EARTHQUAKES

### What is an earthquake and what causes it?
  
An earthquake is an intense shaking of the Earth's surface. it is caused by a sudden slip on a fault. The tectonic plates are always slowly moving, but they get stuck at their edges due to friction. When the stress on the edge overcomes the friction, there is an earthquake that releases energy in waves that travels through the earth's crust which causes the temporary shaking we sense. 
 
### Why do earthquakes exist? What is the importance of earthquakes?
  
Earthquakes are very useful to humans because they provide a picture of what's going on underground. This can make oil and gas extraction more efficient, and allows scientists to monitor the progress of water during geothermal energy extraction. They also tell you what is happening in the structure of the earth, for example, magma chambers, and allow us to monitor volcanoes and the threat of eruption.  

### Why should we prepare for an earthquake?

Earthquake episodes trigger some immediate effects such as ground shaking, surface rupture, damage to human structures and deaths. Called primary effects, these events are directly related to fault movement. Eventually, some other effects may occur due to sustained vibrations and faulting. Such activities, called secondary effects, can be related to other hazards like tsunamis and landslides. Or they can lead to changes in land elevation, fire and even diseases. Earthquakes strike suddenly, violently and without warning. Many injuries suffered during earthquakes result from items falling or shifting due to the shaking of the earth. Identifying potential hazards prior to an earthquake can protect you and your family. Repairing and reinforcing building foundations, securing furniture and other objects to walls and floors, and following local seismic building standards will help reduce the impact of earthquakes.

 
## DO's and DONT's

### What to do before an earthquake

- Make sure you have a fire extinguisher, first aid kit, a battery-powered radio, a flashlight, and extra batteries at home.

- Learn first aid. 

- Learn how to turn off the gas, water, and electricity.

- Make up a plan of where to meet your family after an earthquake. 

- Anchor heavy furniture, cupboards, and appliances to the walls or floor. 

- Learn the earthquake plan at your school or workplace.
  
  ### What to do during an earthquake
  
- **Stay calm!** If you're indoors, stay inside. If you're outside, stay outside.

- If you're indoors, stand against a wall near the center of the building, stand in a doorway, or crawl under heavy furniture (a desk or table). Stay away from windows and outside doors. 

- Drop, cover, and hold. **Drop** down onto your hands and knees before the earthquake knocks you down, **cover** your head and neck (and your entire body if possible) underneath a sturdy table or desk, **hold** on to your shelter (or to your head and neck) until the shaking stops.

- If you're outdoors, stay in the open away from power lines or anything that might fall. Stay away from buildings (stuff might fall off the building or the building could fall on you.)

- If you're in a car, stop the car and stay inside the car until the earthquake stops.
  
  ### What to do after an earthquake
  
- Check yourself and others for injuries. Provide first aid for anyone who needs it.  

- Check water, gas, and electric lines for damage. If any are damaged, shut off the valves. Check for the smell of gas. If you smell it, open all the       windows and doors, leave immediately, and report it to the authorities (use someone else's phone.)  

- Turn on the radio. Don't use the phone unless it's an emergency.

- Stay out of damaged buildings.  

- Be careful around broken glass and debris. Wear boots or sturdy shoes to keep from cutting your feet. 

- Be careful of chimneys (they may fall on you).  

- Stay away from beaches. Tsunamis and seiches sometimes hit after the ground has stopped shaking.  

- Stay away from damaged areas. 

- If you're at school or work, follow the emergency plan or the instructions of the person in charge.
Expect aftershocks.

### What NOT to do in an earthquake

- DO NOT turn on the gas again if you turned it off; let the gas company do it.

- DO NOT use matches, lighters, camp stoves or barbecues, electrical equipment, appliances UNTIL you are sure there are no gas leaks. They may create spark that could ignite leaking gas and cause an explosion and fire.

- DO NOT use your telephone, EXCEPT for a medical or fire emergency. You could tie up the lines needed for emergency response. If the phone doesn't work send someone for help.

- DO NOT expect firefighters, police or paramedics to help you. They may not be available.

- DO NOT leave heavy objects on shelves (they'll fall during a quake).
