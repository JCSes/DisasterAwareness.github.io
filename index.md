### What is an earthquake and what causes it?
  
An earthquake is an intense shaking of the Earth's surface. it is caused by a sudden slip on a fault. The tectonic plates are always slowly moving, but they get stuck at their edges due to friction. When the stress on the edge overcomes the friction, there is an earthquake that releases energy in waves that travels through the earth's crust which causes the temporary shaking we sense.
